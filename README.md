# Automechanics Speak To Robots Obnoxiously

## Problem: 
Robotics, self-driving cars, artifical intelligence and other emerging technologies are disrupters which are very interesting, but will displace a lot of people from their current jobs.

This displacement will cause a career shift for alot of people in mechanic industries. For instance, automotive mechanics who wish to stay current with the automotive industry must learn how to work on electric vehicles. But this is a huge shift from a combustion engine, so they will need a way to learn how to adapt to the changing technologies as electric cars become more standardized. 

The problem is that mechanics who wish to change to more complex industries do not have a interface aimed towards mechanics. (e.g.For my specific problem, my friends who are automotive mechanics think robots are really cool annd want to work on them, but they coding is too difficult so it's not worth it to learn.)

## Solution: 
Create a simple programming language that automotive mechanics can easily understand to create simple programs fro robot execution. 
- The plan is to add language to rasberri pi langauge
- Very simple Debugger 
- Can create simple programs adjust sensors, motors, power adjustments, alignement, send reports to team, etcs  
- Very 'Honey Badger-ish' similar to ANTLR

## Process:: 
I will use a Blaise project and Blaise.g4 provided by my professor to add learn how to create my own language.
